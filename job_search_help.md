### **5. Salary Negotiation Guidance**

GenAI roles, especially at FAANG, are highly competitive and command top-tier compensation.

1.  **Research Total Compensation (TC), Not Just Base Salary:**
    *   FAANG compensation packages are heavily weighted towards **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** and **bonuses**, in addition to base salary. Understand the typical breakdown for your experience level and the specific company.
    *   **Resources:** Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Blind (use with caution, but can provide insights). Look for data specific to ML Engineer, Applied Scientist, Research Scientist at your target companies.

2.  **Never Disclose Your Current Salary or Expectations First:**
    *   When asked about salary expectations, try to deflect by saying something like, "I'm looking for a compensation package that is competitive for this role and my experience at a company like [FAANG company name]," or "I'm open to discussing various components of total compensation and am confident we can find a mutually agreeable package."
    *   If pressed, provide a *broad range* based on your research, ensuring the low end is still acceptable.

3.  **Understand the Offer Components:**
    *   **Base Salary:** Your annual cash salary.
    *   **RSUs (Stock):** Shares of company stock that vest over several years (e.g., 25% each year for 4 years). This is a huge component at FAANG.
    *   **Sign-on Bonus:** A one-time cash bonus, often to offset unvested stock from a previous employer.
    *   **Annual Bonus:** Performance-based cash bonus.
    *   **Benefits:** Health, dental, vision, 401K match, parental leave, PTO, perks (food, gym, etc.).

4.  **Always Negotiate:**
    *   It is expected, and *not* negotiating leaves money on the table.
    *   **Be Prepared to Justify:** If you ask for more, be ready to articulate *why* you believe you deserve it (e.g., "Based on my unique experience in X and Y, and the market rate for this specialized GenAI role, I'm looking for Z in base salary/RSUs.").
    *   **Leverage Other Offers (if you have them):** Having competing offers (especially from other FAANG-level companies) is your strongest negotiation tool. Be transparent but professional: "I've received another offer with a higher base salary/RSU component, and while I'm very excited about [this company], I'd like to see if we can bridge that gap."

5.  **Negotiate Professionally and Persistently:**
    *   Be polite, enthusiastic about the role, but firm in your requests.
    *   Negotiate one component at a time if necessary, but remember the overall TC.
    *   Get everything in writing.

6.  **Consider the "Why":**
    *   Beyond money, what else is important? Team, project, growth opportunities, work-life balance. Sometimes a slightly lower offer is worth it for a better fit or more impactful work.
